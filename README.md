# js-in-sass-in-vue

A Vue project demonstrating how to write Sass functions in JavaScript

Check out [vue.config.js](./vue.config.js) to see how it is done.

## Install dependencies
``` sh
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
``` sh
yarn run serve
```

NOTE: `@vue/cli-service` serve doesn't watch `vue.config.js` for changes, so
you'll need to restart it each time you modify it. For that purpose the
following script was added:

``` sh
yarn run dev
```


### Compiles and minifies for production
``` sh
yarn run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
